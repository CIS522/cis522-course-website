    <h1>Course Description</h1>
    <p>Deep learning techniques now touch on data systems of all varieties. Sometimes, deep learning is a product; sometimes, deep learning optimizes a pipeline; sometimes, deep learning provides critical insights; sometimes, deep learning sheds light on neuroscience. The purpose of this course is to deconstruct the hype by teaching deep learning theories, models, skills, and applications that are useful for applications.</p>
